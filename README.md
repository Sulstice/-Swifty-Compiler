This project is built using Python, Lex, Yacc(PLY) to construct tokens and grammar for an improvised language called Swifty. This project includes recognizes Names, Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Tuples, and Lists. It's features include creating empty lists, and lists of arbtriary lengths that are not static. We have defined one function of stream operations using a Java Class that adds to lists integers. Also demonstrated is the use of lambda expressions to do list comprehension. We have added a function called filter that takes a list and returns the elements of a list based on whether the statement defined is true for each element. Swifty also implements while loops for simple expressions as to whether a number is less than another number as such (while n < 2): Swifty also demonstrates swift closures where the function is defined, parameters are set and the return type is indicated. Swifty compiles with LEX and YACC.py files and intepreted on Jython 2.7
